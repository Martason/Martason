### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anna MÃ¤rta and I currently studying .NET webdeveloper at EC-skolan in Gothenburg, Sweden

I have always been curious about programming and in 2020 I started to learn a little on my own through online courses. Curiosity quickly developed into a passion. In the autumn of 2021, I chose to pause my work in healthcare and wholeheartedly invest in learning programming.
