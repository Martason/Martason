### Hello! 👋

My name is Anna Märta and I currently study .NET webdeveloper at EC-skolan in Gothenburg, Sweden

I have always been curious about programming and in 2019 I started to learn a little on my own through online courses. Curiosity quickly developed into a passion and in the autumn of 2021 I chose to pause my work in healthcare and wholeheartedly invest in learning programming.
