### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anna MÃ¤rta and I am studying .NET web development in Gothenburg, Sweden. I am currently doing my internship, where I am developing in Blazor WASM

I have always been curious about programming, and in 2019, I started to learn on my own through online courses. Curiosity developed into a passion, and in the autumn of 2021, I chose to pause my work in healthcare and wholeheartedly invest in learning programming.

My background as an experienced clinical audiologist brings a unique perspective to my development work, combining my technical skills with a deep understanding of healthcare and patient needs. I am proficient in languages/technologies such as C#, WebAsembly, Blazor, Databases, EF Core, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Asp.NET Core, Web API, CMS, system integration, docker, Agile system development, React.
